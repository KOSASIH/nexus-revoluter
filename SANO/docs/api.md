# SANO API Documentation

## Overview

The SANO API provides a set of endpoints for interacting with the Super Autonomous Nexus Orchestrator (SANO). It allows developers to integrate with the SANO ecosystem, manage resources, and interact with the Pi Network. The API follows RESTful principles and uses JSON for data interchange.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is:

```
https://api.sano.network/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via an API key. You can obtain your API key by registering on the SANO platform. Include the API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Common error responses include:

- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be processed.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed or API key is missing/invalid.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### ## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage of the API, rate limiting is enforced. Each API key is limited to a maximum of 100 requests per minute. Exceeding this limit will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Versioning

The API is versioned to maintain backward compatibility. The current version is `v1`. Future updates may introduce new versions, and users are encouraged to specify the version in the base URL.
