# Super Autonomous Nexus Orchestrator (SANO)

## Introduction

The **Super Autonomous Nexus Orchestrator (SANO)** is a cutting-edge autonomous system designed to streamline and optimize the operations of the nexus-revoluter project and its integration with the Pi Network ecosystem. SANO leverages advanced technologies such as quantum-enhanced AI, blockchain, decentralized storage, and global network orchestration to achieve the following goals:

- **Global Mainnet Launch**: Seamlessly deploy and synchronize the Pi Network open mainnet across millions of nodes worldwide.
- **Stablecoin Stabilization**: Maintain Pi Coin as a stablecoin pegged at $314,159.00 across partners, users, and exchanges.
- **Resource Integrity**: Automatically detect and repair missing code files, broken URLs, and other resource issues in the nexus-revoluter repository.
- **Community Engagement**: Empower Pi Network Pioneers through decentralized governance and incentives.

SANO is built to be self-healing, self-optimizing, and scalable, ensuring robust performance in a decentralized environment with minimal manual intervention.

## Features

SANO provides a comprehensive set of features to support the nexus-revoluter project and Pi Network integration:

### Quantum-AI Predictive Governance
- Uses quantum-enhanced AI to predict network issues (e.g., high latency, node failures) and recommend proactive solutions.
- Optimizes resource allocation and transaction throughput.

### Self-Healing Code Repository
- Automatically detects and repairs missing or corrupted files in the nexus-revoluter repository.
- Generates compatible code using large language models (LLMs) to maintain project integrity.

### Global Mainnet Synchronization
- Orchestrates the Pi Network open mainnet launch, ensuring seamless migration for millions of Pioneers.
- Supports automated KYC verification and wallet synchronization via smart contracts.

### Stablecoin Value Stabilization
- Maintains Pi Coin at $314,159.00 using decentralized reserve protocols and AI-driven arbitrage bots.
- Coordinates with exchanges and partners for consistent pricing.

### URL and Resource Integrity
- Monitors and repairs broken URLs (e.g., documentation, APIs) using IPFS backups.
- Ensures all project resources remain accessible and up-to-date.

### Community-Driven Fault Tolerance
- Engages Pioneers through incentives for transaction validation and bug reporting.
- Implements decentralized voting for governance decisions.

## Architecture

SANO is designed with a modular architecture, consisting of four layers:
- **Community Layer**: Manages Pioneer engagement, voting, and KYC.
- **Application Layer**: Handles AI predictions, stablecoin logic, and mainnet orchestration.
- **Network Layer**: Optimizes global node communication and latency.
- **Resource Layer**: Maintains code repositories and external resources.

For detailed information, refer to [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Prerequisites

To run SANO, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Node.js**: For smart contract deployment (optional)
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment
- **Git**: For repository management
- **IPFS**: For decentralized storage integration
- **Blockchain Node**: Access to a Pi Network-compatible RPC endpoint or Ethereum-like provider

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/nexus-revoluter.git
cd nexus-revoluter
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Settings
Edit `src/config/settings.yaml` with the following:
- Pi Network RPC endpoint (e.g., `https://rpc.pi-network.io`)
- Stablecoin target price (`314159.00`)
- IPFS node address (e.g., `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001`)
- GitHub repository details for nexus-revoluter
- Blockchain account and private key (securely stored)

**Example:**
```yaml
system:
  name: SANO
  version: 1.0.0
stablecoin:
  target_price: 314159.00
network:
  mainnet_endpoint: "https://rpc.pi-network.io"
```

### Set Up Smart Contracts
Deploy smart contracts in `src/core/blockchain/smart_contracts/` using Truffle or Hardhat. Update `settings.yaml` with contract addresses.

### Initialize Logs
```bash
mkdir logs
```

## Usage

### Run SANO
Start the orchestrator:
```bash
python scripts/run_sano.py
```
This initiates continuous monitoring, synchronization, and stabilization cycles.

### Monitor Performance
Check logs in `logs/sano.log` for real-time updates. Use the metrics collector (` src/utils/metrics_collector.py`) for performance reports.

### Deploy Mainnet
Execute the mainnet deployment script:
```bash
bash scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh
```

### Test Components
Run unit tests to verify functionality:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Example Workflow

### Code Repair:
1. SANO detects a missing file in nexus-revoluter.
2. The `code_generator.py` module generates a replacement based on project context.
3. The repaired file is committed and synchronized.

### Stablecoin Adjustment:
1. The `stablecoin_pegger.py` module monitors Pi Coin prices.
2. If the price deviates from $314,159.00, it triggers a mint/burn transaction via smart contracts.

### Mainnet Sync:
1. The `mainnet_orchestrator.py` module coordinates node updates during the Pi Network mainnet launch.
2. KYC verification is automated using `kyc_verification.sol`.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to SANO! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please follow the code style guidelines ([docs/code_style.md](docs/code_style.md)) and include unit tests for new features.

## Limitations

- **Pi Network APIs**: SANO assumes access to Pi Network RPC endpoints. Contact the Pi Network team for official API documentation.
- **Stablecoin Pegging**: Maintaining Pi Coin at $314,159.00 requires real-world economic backing, which is beyond technical scope.
- **Quantum Computing**: Currently uses Qiskit simulators due to limited access to real quantum hardware.
- **nexus-revoluter**: Assumes a blockchain-based structure; adjust SANO for specific project details if needed.

## Roadmap

- Integrate real quantum hardware for enhanced predictions.
- Develop a real-time Pioneer dashboard for mainnet and governance monitoring.
- Support cross-chain interoperability (e.g., Cosmos IBC, Polkadot XCM).
- Enhance privacy with zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption.
