# Decentralized Applications (dApps)

This directory contains decentralized applications (dApps) that are part of the `nexus-revoluter` project. Each dApp is designed to leverage the underlying blockchain infrastructure and provide unique functionalities to users.

## Directory Structure

Each dApp is organized in its own subdirectory within `src/dapps/`. The structure for each dApp should follow this pattern:

```
src/
└── dapps/
    └── example_dapp/
        ├── example_dapp.py      # Main implementation of the dApp
        ├── config.py             # Configuration settings specific to the dApp
        ├── utils.py              # Utility functions for the dApp
        └── tests/                 # Directory for unit tests related to the dApp
            ├── __init__.py        # Makes the tests directory a package
            └── test_example_dapp.py # Unit tests for the example dApp
```

## Adding a New dApp

To add a new dApp to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Directory**: Create a new directory for your dApp under `src/dapps/`. Name the directory according to the dApp's functionality.

2. **Implement the dApp**: Create the main implementation file (e.g., `your_dapp.py`) and any additional files needed (e.g., `config.py`, `utils.py`).

3. **Write Tests**: Create a `tests/` directory within your dApp's folder and add unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected. Name the test file according to the dApp (e.g., `test_your_dapp.py`).

4. **Update Documentation**: If necessary, update the main project documentation to include information about your new dApp.

## Usage

To use the dApps, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. Refer to the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory.

2. **Run the dApp**: Execute the main file of the dApp. For example, to run the example dApp, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python src/dapps/example_dapp/example_dapp.py
   ```

3. **Access the dApp**: Depending on the functionality of the dApp, you may need to interact with it via the API or through a user interface.
