**Nexus Revoluter Launch Guide: Pi Network Global Mainnet**

Welcome to the Nexus Revoluter launch guide, a project designed to make the Pi Network (symbol: Pi) a global open mainnet with a stablecoin value fixed at $314,159.00. With cutting-edge technology such as instant global launch, planetary mesh networks, and quantum transactions, we are ready to activate this network worldwide instantly on April 10, 2025. This guide will walk you through the steps to launch and participate in the mainnet.

**Launch Overview**

Nexus Revoluter enables the Pi Network to become a global mainnet with:
- **Instant Launch:** Distribution of code and blockchain synchronization worldwide in seconds.
- **Universal Connectivity:** Satellite and drone networks ensure access in every corner of the planet.
- **Value Stability:** Pi Coin is maintained at $314,159.00 through quantum AI algorithms and universal price oracles.
- **Accessibility:** Brain-computer interface (BCI) based onboarding and multilingual protocols eliminate participation barriers.
- **Scalability:** Quantum transactions and self-healing blockchain support billions of users.

**Prerequisites**

Before launching or joining the mainnet, ensure you have:
- **Devices:**
  - Smartphone, computer, or IoT device with minimum specifications (2GB RAM, 10GB storage).
  - Optional: AR/VR devices for holographic dashboards or BCI (e.g., Neuralink) for neuro-synchronized onboarding.
- **Connection:**
  - Standard internet, or access to Pi Network satellites/drones in remote areas (see planetary_mesh.py).
- **Dependencies:**
  - Install dependencies from requirements.txt (including quantum, AI, and satellite libraries).
- **Docker (optional):**
  - For node operators, install Docker and Docker Compose to run Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

**Mainnet Launch Steps**

1. **Initiating Instant Global Launch**
   - Nexus Revoluter uses global_instant_deploy.py to distribute the mainnet globally in seconds.
   - For Developers/Early Launchers:
     - Clone Repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/nexus-revoluter.git
     cd nexus-revoluter
     ```
     - Configure Environment:
       - Edit .env to set:

     ```bash
     PI_COIN_VALUE=314159.00
     NETWORK_MODE=global
     DEPLOYMENT_KEY=<your_unique_key>
     ```
     - Run Launch Script:

     ```bash
     python src/main.py --deploy-global
     ```
       - This will activate global_instant_deploy.py, distributing code to global edge servers and synchronizing the blockchain via AI-accelerated CDN.
   - For General Users:
     - No manual action required. The mainnet will automatically be available in your Pi app after the launch is initiated.

2. **Activating the Planetary Mesh Network**
   - The planetary mesh network ensures global connectivity, even in areas without internet.
   - Node Operators:
     - Run the node with:

     ```bash
     python src/node.py --mesh-mode
     ```
       - The node will connect to satellites and drones via planetary_mesh.py.
   - Users in Remote Areas:
     - Download the latest Pi Network app (version supporting satellites).
     - Enable satellite mode in settings for connection through satellite_value_network.py.

3. **Joining the Mainnet**
   - Via Standard App:
     - Open the Pi Network app.
     - Update to the latest mainnet version.
     - Your wallet will automatically synchronize with the Pi Coin value of $314,159.00.
   - Via Neuro-Onboarding (Optional):
     - Connect BCI device (e.g., Neuralink).
     - Run:
       - Think "Join Pi Network" – a wallet will be created based on your brain fingerprint.

4. **Monitoring and Interacting**
   - Holographic Dashboard:
     - Use AR/VR devices to launch:

     ```bash
     python src/holo_dashboard.py
     ```
       - View network status in 3D and manage your wallet with gestures or voice.
   - Real-Time Notifications:
     - Enable notifications in notifications.py for transaction updates and events.

5. **Participating in Global Governance**
   - Voting:

   ```bash
   python src/global_governance_swarm.py
   ```
     - Access governance through:
       - Vote on global proposals using swarm intelligence.
   - DAO:
     - Join the DAO via dao.py for community decisions.

**Key Supported Features**
- **Value Stability:** quantum_price_stabilizer.py and universal_price_oracle.py ensure Pi Coin remains $314,159.00 across the ecosystem.
- **Instant Transactions:** quantum_transaction_mesh.py processes global transactions with zero latency.
- **Resilience:** self_healing_fabric.py automatically repairs blockchain disruptions.
- **Multilingual Access:** uni_language_protocol.py translates transactions into any language in real-time.
- **Interplanetary Ready:** exo_network_layer.py prepares the network for space expansion.

**Troubleshooting**
- **Node Not Synchronizing:**
  - Check satellite connection with planetary_mesh.py --diagnose.
- **Transaction Failed:**
  - Run self_healing_fabric.py --repair to restore the blockchain.
- **Onboarding Issues:**
  - Reset BCI with neuro_onboarding.py --reset.
- See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for further solutions.

**Join the Community**
- **Discussion:** Post on X with the hashtag #PiNetworkMainnet.
- - **Contribution:** Check CONTRIBUTING.md to contribute to the code or documentation.
- **Support:** Contact the team at support@nexus-revoluter.org.

**Important Notes**
- **Launch Date:** April 10, 2025, is the official starting point, but instant launch allows earlier access post-initiation.
- **Global Scale:** The mainnet is designed to support billions of users from day one.
- **Privacy:** All user data is protected by privacy.py and zk_value_lock.py.

Welcome to the launch and welcome to Pi Network – the first truly instant, inclusive, and futuristic global mainnet!
